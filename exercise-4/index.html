            <p class="text-muted h5">
               Here is some columnar text for the 4 column span. As you
               can see, text wraps within this column as you might expect
               it would. This is the first paragraph.

            <p class="text-muted h5">
               To give this span a little more weight, I have added a
               second paragraph, demonstrating that it expands
               according to how much text is placed within it.

            </h2>

            <p class="text-muted h5">
               Here is some columnar text for the 8 column span. As you
               can see, this span is populated with paragraphs that
               wrap within it. This is the first paragraph. Because this
               is a broader span than the 4 column span in Exercise 3, it
               takes far more text before the line wraps. This paragraph
               wraps over three lines.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted h5">
               To give the span a little more weight, I have added a
               second paragraph. In order for this column span to be
               equal in height to its 4 column span neighbor, I need
               to add a significant amount of text, as you can see. I
               just keep rambling on until an equivalent amount of
               vertical spaced is occcupied.
